--Just run the LoginSignup html sheet
--things i would like to add:
     1. checking the length of the password (password must be atleast 8 characters)
     2. Accurate email type has been entered(.com or .ac.za or hotmail idk..).
       right now it just checks if a correct email address has been entered and if the email is in the storage.
     3. Lastly a link route to the home page. At the moment once an account is successfully login it writes in the console
     "route to home page" so actual routting to home page must be added at the end.
