# WPR281-ass2: Bug Tracking system
The Bug tracking system was created by the following students from Belgium Campus Pretoria:
Emile Botha (577701)
Neill Engelbrecht (577504)
Nosipho Precious Donkrag (577354)

   ##**The Bug Tracking System**
    The following project was created to log and monitor bugs or errors that may occur during the testing of different software programs. The system is created with the aim of supporting project management in the software industry and efficient communication of problems (bugs/errors) between team members.
  ###**How it works**
  The system allows different users to create an account and login. Once the account has been created the user information is stored on the local storage under “AllUsers”. This allows for the persistence of user information throughout the session.
  Once the user has logged-in they are routed to the home page. Under the home page the user can add a project, edit and remove a project; they can navigate to an existing project where they can add, edit or remove a **ticket**. 
  A ticket is a bug or error found in a specific project. The system allows the users and the projects to be linked together through a ticket-ID. In this way the system allows you to see who launched a ticket for a specific project as well as when it was launched.
  The projects and the tickets are also stored in the local storage under “Projects” and “Tickets”.
